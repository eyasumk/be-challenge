# AI Usage Documentation
This project includes AI‑assisted components. The following documentation provides full transparency about how AI tools were used during development, in accordance with the challenge requirements.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Copilot (primary assistant)

- No other AI tools were used.

## Purpose of AI Assistance
AI assistance was used to accelerate boilerplate creation and ensure clean architectural structure. All logic was reviewed, validated, and modified manually.

## AI was used for:

- Designing the initial project structure

- Generating TypeScript/Express boilerplate

- Drafting SQL schema for SQLite

- Writing route handlers and service logic

- Producing documentation (README + this artifact)

## AI was not used for:

- Writing tests

- Debugging runtime issues

- Designing the final architecture (human‑reviewed and adjusted)

- Final code cleanup and refactoring
